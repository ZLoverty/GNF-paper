\textbf{Spatial and temporal correlations of density and velocity.}
(a) and (b) are density spatial correlation functions and autocorrelation functions.
(c) and (d) are velocity spatial correlation functions and autocorrelation functions. 
(e) Correlation lengths of both density and velocity correlation functions, defined as the distance $\lambda$ where $C_{n(v)}(\lambda)=1/e$.
(f) Autocorrelation times of both density and velocity autocorrelation functions, defined as the time $\tau$ where $C_{n(v)}(\tau)=1/e$.
