# PRX submission folder
Organize the files for PRX submission in this folder.
## General guidelines
1. This folder has 2 subfolder
  - Figures, which contains the finalized version of all the figures.
  - Supplemental material, which contains the videos for the submission.
2. Figures no longer need to be in separate folders. Under Figures folder, put figures with names "fig-1.pdf" ... "fig-n.pdf".
3. PRX does not have text SM, so only put supplementary videos here.
4. Ideas about this submission should be recorded in this document.
