v4: Concentration dependence of GNF.
----
(a) Standard deviation of particle number $\Delta N$ scaled by particle mean number $N$ plotted against subsystem size rescaled by single bacterium size $l^2/l_b^2$ in bacterial suspensions at volume fractions ranging from 0.8\% to 9.6\%. 
(b) Concentration dependence of the magnitude of GNF $\alpha$ (blue circles) and kinetic energy $E$ (orange squares).
