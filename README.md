# GNF-paper
version control my paper draft on giant number fluctuations.

## When should I start a new version?

Rule of thumb is to do it whenever a stable version, or an acceptable version is reached. Each version should be a complete document, rather than having some issues unresolved. If major change is made, for example *title* or *story line* changes, a new version should start.

## Versions
- V0: Correlations and Fluctuations 3-D in Bacterial Suspensions
- V1: Giant Number Fluctuations and Energy Spectra in 3-D Bacterial Turbulence
- V2: Change figure organizations
- **V3: Update spatial and temporal correlation, density-flow coupling at transient state**
## Rules
- Only keep essential files: tex/pdf/bib and two folders Figures/SI
## File organization
