# GNF-paper
version control my paper draft on giant number fluctuations.

I will keep on updating this read me as soon as important improvement is made.

## Progress - Sep 26, 2020

The first draft is almost done. Some parts of the text are still being considered and are likely to be modified - I colored those sentences red.

In particular, I have 3 concerns:

- I would like to show the ratio between velocity correlation length and concentration correlation length (which converges to 2 at high concentrations). However, the interpretation of this ratio is left as an open question.

- We choose divergence, vorticity, convection and divergence of concentration weighted velocity as candidates of driving force. However, I haven't come up with a good way to rationalize these choices.

- Discussion about dimensionality effect is not satisfactory.
