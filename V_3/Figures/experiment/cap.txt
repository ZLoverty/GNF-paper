---------------
(a) Bacterial active turbulence displaying constantly varying concentration inhomogeneity (6.4\%). Scale bar is 85 \textmu m.
(b) Velocity field of a dilute bacterial suspension ($\phi=6.4\%$). 
(c) Volume fraction as a function of averaged pixel intensities. Inset shows bacterial suspensions of different volume fractions under the same illumination conditions.
(d) Velocity and concentration spatial correlation functions $C_{v}(r)$ and $C_{n}(r)$.
