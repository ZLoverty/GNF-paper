	abstract = {Ensembles of collectively moving particles like flocks of birds, bacteria, or filamentous polymers show a broad range of intriguing phenomena, yet seem to obey very similar physical principles. These generic principles have been predicted to lead to characteristic density fluctuations, which are in sharp contrast to normal fluctuations determining the properties of ordered systems in thermal equilibrium. Using high-density motility assays of driven filaments, we characterize here the origin and nature of giant fluctuations that emerge in this class of systems. By showing that these unique statistical properties result from the coupling between particle density and the topology of the velocity field of the particles, we provide insight in the physics of collective motion.},
