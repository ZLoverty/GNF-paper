    abstract = { Active matter physics is about systems in which energy is dissipated at some local level to produce work. This is a generic situation, particularly in the living world but not only. What is at stake is the understanding of the fascinating, sometimes counterintuitive, emerging phenomena observed, from collective motion in animal groups to in vitro dynamical self-organization of motor proteins and biofilaments. Dry aligning dilute active matter (DADAM) is a corner of the multidimensional, fast-growing domain of active matter that has both historical and theoretical importance for the entire field. This restrictive setting only involves self-propulsion/activity, alignment, and noise, yet unexpected collective properties can emerge from it. This review provides a personal but synthetic and coherent overview of DADAM, focusing on the collective-level phenomenology of simple active particle models representing basic classes of systems and on the solutions of the continuous hydrodynamic theories that can be derived from them. The obvious fact that orientational order is advected by the aligning active particles at play is shown to be at the root of the most striking properties of DADAM systems: (a) direct transitions to orientational order are not observed; (b) instead generic phase separation occurs with a coexistence phase involving inhomogeneous nonlinear structures; (c) orientational order, which can be long range even in two dimensions, is accompanied by long-range correlations and anomalous fluctuations; (d) defects are not point-like, topologically bound objects. }
