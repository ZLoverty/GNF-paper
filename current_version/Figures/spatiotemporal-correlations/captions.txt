(a-c) Velocity and concentration spatial correlation functions $C_{v}(r)$  and $C_{n}(r)$ and correlation lengths $\lambda$,
(d-f) Velocity and concentration temporal autocorrelation functions $C_{t, v}(t)$  and $C_{t, n}(t)$ and correlation times $\tau$ at volume fractions ranging from 0.8\% to 9.6\%.
